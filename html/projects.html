                    <h2>Flocking Hell</h2>
                    <p> In this third-person shooting game you have to defeat all enemies in order to progress to the
                        next wave.
                        Between waves you are able to upgrade your stats. This game is called flocking hell because of
                        the way the enemies are behaving.
                        It is a flocking hell.
                    </p>
                    <p> I made this game alone as part of my third year at the Hanze University
                        of Applied Sciences.
                        The assignment was to show one or more technique(s). I chose the flocking technique and the AI
                        (Artificial Intelligence)
                        states technique for this assignment.
