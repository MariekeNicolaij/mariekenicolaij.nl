                    <h2>Frozen Flowerz</h2>
                    <p>
                        In this game you have to complete each level. Each level consists of frozen flower blocks which
                        you have to destroy in order to complete the level.
                        You need to be the same color as the block in order to destroy. Each level is a different puzzle
                        with new elements.
